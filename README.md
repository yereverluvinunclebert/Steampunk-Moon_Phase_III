# Steampunk Moon_Phase_III

 
 Steampunk Moon_Phase_III widget, written in Javascript and XML for the Yahoo 
 Widget (Konfabulator) Engine. Created for XP, Vista, Win7, 8, 10+ as well as the 
 Apple Mac.
 
This widget is an attractive steampunk Yahoo widget for your desktop. The Steam 
Punk Yahoo Widget for your Windows/Mac desktop, a fully working yahoo widget 
and it can be moved around your desktop looking very steampunk indeed. 
It displays a beautiful moon globe that you can resize at will and that will 
display through the phases according to any date supplied
  
It is shown here on top of the steampunk orrery widget, the reason for this is 
that the orrery is the natural home for the moon phase widget. When the orrery 
runs, it controls the moon phase widget, passing the dates it is calculating to 
the moon widget for it to display the current moon phase. The orrery places the 
moon phase widget on the correct location for the screen and makes it appear 
when it is required.
