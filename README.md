It is shown here on top of the steampunk orrery widget, the reason for this is 
that the orrery is the natural home for the moon phase widget. When the orrery 
runs, it controls the moon phase widget, passing the dates it is calculating to 
the moon widget for it to display the current moon phase. The orrery places the 
moon phase widget on the correct location for the screen and makes it appear 
when it is required.
